## ‚úÖ Step 1: Define the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Before writing any code, it's critical to **nail down exactly what the first version of Submind will do.** Here's a solid MVP scope:

---

### üîπ Submind MVP Goal:

> "Create a local multi-agent AI system that accepts personal goals as input, plans a sequence of tasks, and executes those tasks autonomously overnight to generate code or reports, which are saved and available to the user in the morning."

---

### üéØ MVP Features

1. **Command-line interface** to set a personal goal (e.g., ‚ÄúBuild a personal blog with Next.js‚Äù or ‚ÄúGenerate a study plan for calculus‚Äù).
2. **Task planner agent** that breaks the goal into sub-tasks.
3. **Specialized agents** (coder, researcher, writer) that handle each sub-task.
4. **Autonomous loop** that runs overnight (simulated with `async` job queue and sleep/delay).
5. **Local storage** of outputs in a structured folder (e.g., `/submind_outputs/yyyy-mm-dd/`).
6. **Single-user mode**, no authentication needed yet.

### üîß Tools & Stack for MVP

| Component                  | Tech                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Language                   | Python 3.10+                           |
| AI models (local/remote)   | OpenAI API (GPT-4) OR Ollama/LM Studio |
| Task scheduling            | `asyncio` + background loop            |
| Memory (short-term)        | In-memory or JSON files                |
| Storage/output             | Markdown/HTML/PDF reports              |
| CLI                        | `argparse` or `Typer`                  |
| Agent framework (optional) | `Langchain`, `CrewAI`, or custom       |

Once this scope looks good to you, Step 2 will be to **set up the basic project scaffold and CLI interface**.
